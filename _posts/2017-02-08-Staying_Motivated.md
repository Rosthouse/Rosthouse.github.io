Oi, that was a douzy. Do you feel the next project coming? The ideas, bubbling up and taking over?

## FOCUS!
The hardest part so far for me is staying motivated for a full project. I've never been so close to finishing a complete game (A shout out to all the prototypes and half-finished games somewhere on my disk,)) and the only things keeping me going are

* My Girlfriend
* Seeing the end of the tunnel

Not that I hate the game I'm working on, not at all. I think it's a really fun idea. But I can't work on it forever, nor do I want to.

Today I started developing with the intention of finishing it. Really get it out there. Couldn't do it, there's just so many small details still missing. Music, Sound FX, some animations, a proper title screen, credits for external assets, displaying score in the game, a level-loading screen...
I could go on.

But at the back of my head, another idea is already forming. I have to keep it at bay, see that it won't take over my mind.

## PROGRESS!
That all said, I did manage to make some progress. The last remnants of the old medival theme are now purged from the main game (some are still left in the menu). 
Also, I manage to fix the spawning issue. The more you score, the more lemmings are on screen.

## STAY TUNED!
I will continue working on this game. Personally, I think I'm very close to finishing it. As said, I got other ideas. But before I start chassing a dragon, I want to at least finish this game. I know I can do it.
