This is the most idiotic project I ever did. It was glorious!

## BACKSTORY!
Around 2011, Ubisoft [announced](https://www.nzz.ch/die-schweiz-hat-gute-junge-game-designer-1.12500493) that they would open a studio in ZÃ¼rich (which they closed again, [about 2 years later](http://www.pctipp.ch/news/firmen/artikel/ubisoft-zuerich-schliesst-69825/)). I was hyped. Maybe this was my chance to get into the industry. At least I had to try. 

I needed to be innovative, show what I could do. I decided I would create a game as my CV!

## THE GAMIFIED CV!
My mind was racing, but also quite clear actually. Quickly I realized that I need to be able to easily distribute this game. No installation, no complicated build process. It would just run.
So I wrote a javascript game engine. Mind you this was before all those popular HTML5 engine popped up. I wrote the whole thing by myself.

## MY POINTS IN LIFE!
I wanted to show some things clearly:
- I know games since the cradle-
- I can make games!
- I had a [Matura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matura#In_Switzerland)
- I am creative

In a way, I did achieve that. Certainly with creativity

## WHAT EVEN IS THIS?

Yeah, to show that I started with games early, I created a GAME BOY STROLLER (!?!) and put a Mii version of myself in there. It's so damn ridiculous, I can't believe it right now. But awesome in some way.

In the first level, you had to collect grades while driving along a beach in the GAME BOY STROLLER (I swear, I have never even touched weed). Afterwards, there was a challenge in the gym room, where you had to climb a rope. And in the next level, you were taking your final exams, while trying not to get distracted by people walking by left and right of you (showing my problems with concentration).

## TRY IT!
You can either download it directly [here](https://github.com/Rosthouse/MyWayToYou/archive/master.zip) or clone the whole thing from [github](https://github.com/Rosthouse/MyWayToYou). Just open the file index.html in a browser and have fun!
